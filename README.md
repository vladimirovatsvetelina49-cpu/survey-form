# Survey Form

A survey form built with **HTML & CSS** as part of the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certification.  
This project demonstrates form inputs, fieldsets, labels, and basic layout styling.

##  What I Practiced
- HTML forms (inputs, radio buttons, checkboxes, dropdowns, text areas)
- Using `<fieldset>` and `<label>` for accessibility
- Organizing content with semantic HTML
- Basic CSS for spacing, alignment, and styling

##  Next Steps
- Add responsive design with Flexbox/Grid  
- Style with modern fonts and colors  
- Improve accessibility (ARIA attributes, screen-reader friendly labels)
